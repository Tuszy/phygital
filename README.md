## Description

This project demonstrates a simple but efficient way of how to "phygitalize" a product by using an intelligent NFC tag with any modern mobile phone that supports NFC.

> Phygitalization: Making a connection between the physical and digital world based on a decentralized blockchain solution.

Phygitals allow the creative economy to onboard normies effortlessly into the digital world by leveraging traditional sales channels like physical stores. 

Nowadays most of the phygitals are firstly minted in the digital world and then transitioned into to the physical world by a process called forging (e.g. RTFKT). This process is great and innovative - but has a big disadvantage. 
The target market is reduced to tech-savvy people who must be well acquainted with the functionality of blockchain to be able to deal with its hidden risks and challenges. Transactions, gas fees, seed phrases, wallets, phishing, front running, account addresses, private keys, public keys, block explorer yada yada yada - are nothing the normie gives a shit about or rather even makes him/her drop the idea of getting involved in the new creative economy. 

So, let us change this.

We are confronted with the task of making the onboarding as simple and stupid as possible, so that everyone, no matter the age, gender, tech savviness is able to take part in the digital world. 

The problems we have to solve are not easy but manageable.
We have to ask ourselves what do the normie understand and how much time is he/she ready to spend in todays "short attention" world (thanks TikTok...) to get involved. 

Let's assume that everyone who is using the internet, has got a modern mobile phone with NFC functionality. Furthermore we also expect that they know how to surf the internet with a browser and download an app. Awesome! We have everything that we need to implement our solution:

We need:

1. Simple Web Application to add a controller to the key manager of the universal profile 
2. Intelligent NFC tag that can be embedded into any physical product
3. Mobile Application that allows us to communicate with the NFC tag and connect it to the blockchain  (=> phygitalize the product)
4. Smart Contract that allows us to mint the product ("digital twin") on the blockchain

All of the above tasks must be implemented within 4 weeks during Lukso's BuildUP Hackathon #2 (30th Oct till 27th Nov). Not a lot of time, so I'll probably have to cut some corners. Please keep in mind, that I am a dev with almost no know-how in electronics, so the NFC tag implementation will probably lack best practices and will not be ready for production. Nevertheless I wanted to accept the challenge since I love the idea of the Lukso Tag and it was the reason why I got interested in Lukso in August 2020.
